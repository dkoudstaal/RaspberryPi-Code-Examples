#### Code Examples
These are code examples for the courses designed with a highschool and or college learner in mind. It is assumed you are a beginner in programming and html mark-up.

Some code snippets might not be completed as students are asked to modify some of these programs.
These programs are aimed at students who have no prior experience in programming or with mark-up languages.

The code examples are so basic, it would be ridiculus for me to claim any rights or ownership.
Feel free to use it in any way you want!
