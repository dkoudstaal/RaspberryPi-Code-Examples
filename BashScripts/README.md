StudentNetworkTools Version 0.5

Program and concept: (c) 2018 Dirk Koudstaal and (c) 2018 Kim Knight

#### Preamble
Our introductory network students have to move around computer equipment to test their created network. We had old Raspberry Pi boards laying around from our introductory computer programming courses. Kim thought it an improvement if the students could carry a Raspberry Pi board with small attached screen and small wireless keyboard to test their created network.
#### Installation
The easiest would be to transfer the image net_tools.img to a SD card using etcher.
