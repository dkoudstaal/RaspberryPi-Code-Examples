                       (c) 2018 Kim Knight
 
  License:
    There is no license on this bit of scripting.
    It would be rediculous if we claim a license 
    as this script is just "glueing" together
    known Bash and Linux commands.

  Installation:
    The easiest would be to transfer the image
    StudentNetworkTools.img to a SD card using etcher.

  File location:
    All files are located in /home/pi/.net_tools
    Files accessed and modified by this program:
 	    /etc/dhcpcd/conf
 	    /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant

    Start the progam from the command line, type:
 	    ./network
