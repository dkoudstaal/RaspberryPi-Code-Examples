###Raspberry Pi Camera Instructions
There are excellent installation instructions on the [Raspberry Pi site]
 (https://www.raspberrypi.org).
 
 However, 
 
 **Never connect the camera when the Raspberry Pi is turned on!**
 
 **Only connect the camera when the Pi is turned off!**
 
 Your little camera circuit board will be damaged and your camera will not work.

###Creating the push-button circuit used in some of the code
The circuit for a [push-button is very well explained in a tutorial] (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/buttons_and_switches/)
created by students from [Computer Lab Raspberry Pi Tutorials] (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/) of Cambridge University.
